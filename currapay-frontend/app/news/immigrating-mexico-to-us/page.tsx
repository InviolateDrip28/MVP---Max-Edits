          <li>
            <b>Legal Barriers:</b> Navigating the U.S. immigration
            system can be complex and daunting. Applicants may face
            long wait times, especially for family-based visas, and
            legal issues that may arise from previous immigration
            violations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cultural Adjustment:</b> Moving to a new country
            involves significant cultural adjustments. Immigrants may
            face challenges related to language barriers, different
            social norms, and establishing new support networks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Economic Considerations: </b> While many seek better
            economic opportunities, newcomers often encounter
            difficulties in finding employment that matches their
            skills and qualifications, leading to underemployment.
